                        <p>If you want to know a little about me...</p>
                        <p>I studied software engineering. Back in the time I was so excited to be a 
                            teacher and I started my carrier 
                            as a techer in a technical highschool teching Visual Basic. Then I started 
                            to learn accounting and started to build accounting software for small businesses
                            using SQL Server and Delphi. Now I want to continue my carrier as a web developer 
                            and build website and comunicate with people this way.

                            <p>Where do I live ???</p>
                        <p>
                            I live in Los Angeles California. I used to live in beautiful San Francisco 
                            For 4 Years. Now I'm exploring the mystery of Los Angeles. I found good friends 
                            here and still getting to know more people. Los Angeles sounds promising to me.

                        <p> My hobbies are...</p>
                        <p>
                            I like hiking and exploring places that are diffrent. I like the whole package.
                            For example I visited El Matador 
                            Beach located in Malibu and after getting some sun and couple of picture 
                            I had my dinner in a fantastic seafood restuarant serving fresh seafood.
                            Yummy....
