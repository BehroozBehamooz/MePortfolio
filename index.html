                        <h3>Education and career history...</h3>
                        <p>I studied software engineering. Back in the time I was so excited to be a 
                            teacher and I started my carrier 
                            as a techer in a technical highschool teching Visual Basic. Then I started 
                            to learn accounting and started to build accounting software for small businesses
                            using SQL Server and Delphi. Now I want to continue my carrier as a web developer 
                            and build website and comunicate with people this way.

                            I live in Los Angeles California. I used to live in beautiful San Francisco 
                            For 4 Years. Now I'm exploring the mystery of Los Angeles. I found some good friends 
                            here and still getting to know more people. Los Angeles sounds promising to me.

                        <p>
                            I would like to connect to and work with other web developers no matter if they are new to 
                            this field or professionals. Although working as a team is inevitable, it is encouraging and 
                            motivational. Getting to know other people with the same goal is just awesome. As a team we 
                            share ideas issues and questions and we find solutions. I'm open to participate in any projects 
                            and will spend a lot of time to make something diffrent happen. 
                            My contact information is provided at the bottom of this page.
